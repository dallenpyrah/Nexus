# **Nexus**

Nexus is a desktop application designed for developers who have encountered challenging questions that cannot be solved by a simple Google search. It allows developers to submit their questions to a community of peers and receive helpful suggestions from other members of the community, as well as AI-powered responses.

## **How it works**

After downloading and installing the Nexus application, developers can log in and submit a question to the community. The question will be posted to a relevant group, where other developers and AI-powered bots can see it and offer suggestions on how to solve the problem.

The AI component of Nexus uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze the question and suggest possible solutions based on previous solutions and answers provided by the community.

Developers can then review and test the suggestions provided by the community and AI-powered bots, and mark the best solution as accepted to help other developers who may encounter the same problem in the future.

## **Features**

- Submit questions to a relevant group for feedback
- Receive helpful suggestions from other developers and AI-powered bots
- Accept the best solution to help other developers in the future
- View past questions and solutions for reference
- Customize settings to control which groups to receive notifications from
